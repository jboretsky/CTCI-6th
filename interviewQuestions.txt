How extensive is testing? Are developers expected to write tests other than unit tests? How many testers and interaction between devs and testers?

How do you like working at the company?

I'm really interested in object oriented coding pattern, what kind of patterns are used at the company?

What is the dev environment like? What operating systems do you work on, what version control, etc?

How is the onboarding process? How long do you expect new hires to take to get up to speed?
